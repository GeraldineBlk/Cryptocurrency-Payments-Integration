# Cryptocurrency Payments Integration
Integrate cryptocurrency payment gateways into an existing e-commerce platform or website.

To provide you with a very detailed and advanced Python code for Cryptocurrency Payments Integration, I'll present an example using the popular cryptocurrency payment gateway provider, Coinbase Commerce. Please note that the actual integration may differ based on the chosen provider's API and documentation.

Step 1: Set Up Coinbase Commerce Account

Sign up for a Coinbase Commerce account at https://commerce.coinbase.com/.
Obtain the necessary API keys from the Coinbase Commerce dashboard.
Step 2: Install Required Libraries
You need to install the requests library to make API calls and Flask to handle payment callbacks.
pip install requests Flask
